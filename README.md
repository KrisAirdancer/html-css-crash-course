## Notes

- HTML provides the structure for a webpage while CSS provides the styling  (colors, etc.).
- You can view a local .html file (or any other file type for that matter) in a browser by pasting the local address into the browser URL bar.
- Pro Tip: Use the developer tools in a browser (inspect) to reverse engineer a website or elements on a website you want to replicate.
